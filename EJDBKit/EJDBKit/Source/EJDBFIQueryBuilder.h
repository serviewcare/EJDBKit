/**
 This class is a utility to create ejdb queries in a programmatic fashion using a fluent interface paradigm.
 Instead of repeatedly sending messages you can chain multiple query construction steps.
 Every method in this class (excluding the build method) takes various types of blocks as "parameters"
 to make this happen.
 Note: They aren't really method parameters in the traditional sense as they are actually return values but syntactically they
 appear as such when written in code as the following example illustrates:
 
     [EJDBFIQueryBuilder build].match(@"a",@1).beginsWith(@"b",@"prefix");
 
 Take a look at the tests for more complex examples of using this class.
 If you are an objective-c purist and believe this is as an abomination :), take a look at the EJDBQueryBuilder
 class for a more traditional means of building queries.

 The class method that should be used to build queries. You can chain multiple block calls like so:

                                 .beginsWith(@"b",@"prefix");
 
 You CANNOT however, do something like this:
 
       EJDBFIQueryBuilder *builder = [EJDBFIQueryBuilder build];
       build.match(@"a",@1).beginsWith(@"b",@"prefix");
 
 because the underlying dictionaries that hold the query and the hints are immutable and will be effectively
 "finalized" using the last approach.
